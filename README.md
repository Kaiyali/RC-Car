# RC-Car

 ## Objective

> The objective of this project is to create a remote control car using an Arduino and IR sensors. The Arduino, a microcontroller board, will be used as the brain of the car to control its motors and receive input from the IR sensors. The IR sensors will be used to detect obstacles or track a specific IR remote control signal, which the Arduino will then process to control the car's movement. To build the RC car, the sensors will be connected to the Arduino, code will be written to control the car's motors and interpret sensor input, and power will be supplied by a battery. With the right programming, the Arduino will be able to control the speed, direction and any other function of the RC car.

## Brainstorming and Ideation
> When we started we had in mind to build a vehicle, at first we wanted to build a drone, we thought about and looked at the materials we have in class, we realized it was impossible because we need light weight components and very small and powerful motors. Also we need strong and lightweight propellers. That whole idea was just impossible. And we finally got it, an RC car, the moment we had that idea we hopped on tinkercad and started designing and drawing our ideas.

 ## Process:

#### `Step One:` Sketching the car using Tinkercad 3D.

* This step involves using a 3D modeling software, Tinkercad, to design and create a virtual model of the car. The design should include the dimensions and layout of the car, as well as the placement of the motors, IR sensors, and other components.

#### `Step Two:` Lazering our designs on a laser cutter

from Tinkercad and sent to a laser cutter to be cut out of a material such as acrylic or wood.

#### `Step Three:` Make the motor work

* In this step, you will connect the motors to the arduino board and write the code to control the motors' speed and direction. This will involve configuring the arduino board's pins and using the appropriate libraries to control the motors.

#### `Step Four:` Make the stepper motor to work

* The stepper motor is a special kind of motor that can be controlled with high precision. In this step, you will connect the stepper motor to the arduino board and write the code to control it. This will involve configuring the arduino board's pins and using the appropriate libraries to control the stepper motor.

#### `Step Five:` Placing everything together

* Once the motors and sensors are working, you will place them into the car's design, connecting gears and motors to make the car move as designed. This step also includes connecting the battery to the arduino board and testing the car's movement and functions.

#### `Step Six:` Connecting the gears and the motors to make the car move as designed

* This step involves putting the gears and motors together, making sure that they are properly connected and aligned. This step also includes connecting the battery to the arduino board and testing the car's movement and functions.

#### What issues have you had in working on your projects?  You may list as many as you can think of.  Please explain how you overcame those problems or fixed them. 

> The circuit design for regulating the motor's direction of rotation was one of our project's most difficult tasks. We needed help dealing with many wires, resistors, and transistors, as well as with the coding. We used Tinkercad, a digital circuit design programme, to experiment with various circuit topologies to solve this issue. We also read a lot from other places to better grasp the code and how to manage the motor's rotation direction. We eventually succeeded in designing a real-world circuit and writing the code to regulate the motor's rotational direction.

#### What is still remaining to be done in your project if you had more time to work on it?  How would you improve your project?  Is there a possibility for making it even more functional?
> We would seek to increase the functionality of our concept if we had more time to work on it by including better tyres and collision detection sensors. Better tyres would improve the vehicle's movement and performance, making it more efficient and dependable. Adding collision detection sensors would also allow the automobile to recognize impediments in its path and stop before a collision happens. Another change is to design the automobile using a 3D printer, allowing us to construct more intricate and exact elements, making the car seem more polished and sleek. We aim to improve the car's functioning and look over time, making it more practical and user-friendly.

#### What was fun and/or frustrating about your project?  How would you approach your project differently next time?
> Making an RC vehicle using Arduino and IR sensors was fun and challenging. Dealing with the code was one of the more annoying elements, as it did not continuously operate as planned. We frequently felt disoriented and unneeded to learn to solve the problems we were experiencing. In retrospect, we preferred more robust engines since they would have allowed the automobile to travel more smoothly and efficiently. Furthermore, we would have tackled the project differently if we had used a joystick controller instead of an outdated TV remote-like device. It would have given the driver additional accuracy and control over the vehicle's motions. Despite the difficulties, the moment the motors finally started operating was a big thrill for us, and it was the best time we had while building the RC vehicle. The joy of seeing the automobile move on its own after all of our hard work and effort was highly remarkable.

### Proposal

> We suggest building an RC vehicle with motors and infrared sensors. The project will entail designing and constructing a miniature toy automobile utilizing an Arduino board and different electronic components. To accomplish this project, we will need to have a better grasp of how motors and IR sensors function and improve our coding abilities to manage the car's motions effectively. Tinkercad 3D will be used to produce a virtual automobile model, and the design will be laser-cut using a laser cutter. The project will take some time and work, but we are convinced that the end result will be a fun and practical addition to the class. We'll need an Arduino board, a motor, IR sensors, gears, wiring, and a laser cutter. Before we begin the project, we will need to plan our time and ensure we have everything we need. We want to work on this project for the semester and present it as a group at the conclusion.
