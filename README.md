# RC-Car

 ## Objective

> The objective of this project is to create a remote control car using an Arduino and IR sensors. The Arduino, a microcontroller board, will be used as the brain of the car to control its motors and receive input from the IR sensors. The IR sensors will be used to detect obstacles or track a specific IR remote control signal, which the Arduino will then process to control the car's movement. To build the RC car, the sensors will be connected to the Arduino, code will be written to control the car's motors and interpret sensor input, and power will be supplied by a battery. With the right programming, the Arduino will be able to control the speed, direction and any other function of the RC car.

## Brainstorming and Ideation
> When we started we had in mind to build a vehicle, at first we wanted to build a drone, we thought about and looked at the materials we have in class, we realized it was impossible because we need light weight components and very small and powerful motors. Also we need strong and lightweight propellers. That whole idea was just impossible. And we finally got it, an RC car, the moment we had that idea we hopped on tinkercad and started designing and drawing our ideas.

 ## Process:

#### `Step One:` Sketching the car using Tinkercad 3D.

* This step involves using a 3D modeling software, Tinkercad, to design and create a virtual model of the car. The design should include the dimensions and layout of the car, as well as the placement of the motors, IR sensors, and other components.

#### `Step Two:` Lazering our designs on a laser cutter

* Once the design is complete, it can be exported from Tinkercad and sent to a laser cutter to be cut out of a material such as acrylic or wood.

#### `Step Three:` Make the motor work

* In this step, you will connect the motors to the arduino board and write the code to control the motors' speed and direction. This will involve configuring the arduino board's pins and using the appropriate libraries to control the motors.

#### `Step Four:` Make the stepper motor to work

* The stepper motor is a special kind of motor that can be controlled with high precision. In this step, you will connect the stepper motor to the arduino board and write the code to control it. This will involve configuring the arduino board's pins and using the appropriate libraries to control the stepper motor.

#### `Step Five:` Placing everything together

* Once the motors and sensors are working, you will place them into the car's design, connecting gears and motors to make the car move as designed. This step also includes connecting the battery to the arduino board and testing the car's movement and functions.

#### `Step Six:` Connecting the gears and the motors to make the car move as designed

* This step involves putting the gears and motors together, making sure that they are properly connected and aligned. This step also includes connecting the battery to the arduino board and testing the car's movement and functions.
